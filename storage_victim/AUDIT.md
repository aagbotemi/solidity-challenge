## Audit Report

### Summary

The contract StorageVictim was written in Solidity version 0.4.23. It has a store function that stores the amount of ether sent by the user in a mapping. The getStore function returns the amount of ether stored by the user. The getOwner function returns the owner of the contract.

### Findings

1. The contract uses an older version of Solidity (0.4.23) which is not recommended for new contracts. It is recommended to use the latest stable version of Solidity (0.8.9 at the time of writing this report) to take advantage of the latest security fixes and features.

2. The store function uses an uninitialized pointer str. str.user points to the storage address 0 which is the owner of the contract. This is a security vulnerability as it allows the owner to overwrite the data of other users. 

### Recommendations

1. Upgrade the contract to the latest stable version of Solidity (0.8.9 at the time of writing this report).

2. Initialize the str pointer before using it to store data. This can be done by replacing the line Storage str; with Storage memory str = Storage(msg.sender, _amount);.

### Conclusion

The contract StorageVictim has two security vulnerabilities that can be fixed by upgrading the contract to the latest stable version of Solidity and initializing the str pointer before using it to store data.
